            <p className='annual-report--text'>ShelterTech is an award winning non-profit solving the biggest technology challenges faced by people experiencing homelessness.</p>
            <p className='annual-report--text'>Founded in 2016, ShelterTech is now a 100 member strong volunteer-only organisation with over $100,000 in annual funding, $800,000 in in-kind contributions, and 3 program offerings.</p>
            <p className='annual-report--text'>In 2018, we faced a serious challenge as founders and key leaders moved out of state. Could we build a resilient organisation, able to deliver world-class technology products for homeless communities, all while completely volunteer led and operated? The short answer is: Yes! We tripled in size, outpaced all our goals, and expanded all our programs. We can’t wait for an exciting 2019.</p>
